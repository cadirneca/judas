The files in this folder belongs to the DFRWS IoT forensic challenge 2017/18 (https://www.dfrws.org/dfrws-forensic-challenge).
These are only a part of all the files of the use case, that can be downloaded from github: https://github.com/dfrws/dfrws2018-challenge/

Specifically, the files in this folder are only:

- the files for the Amazon Alexa Cloud repository that are in: /echo/(2018-07-01_13.17.01)_CIFT_RESULT/Evidence_Library/AmazonAlexaCloud
- the .pcap file in the folder 'network'

Only these files were provided for simplicity, but you can download all the files for the challenge and customise this
tool in order to make your own analysis and correlation of results.
